Requirement Analysis in Software Development
Introduction

This repository — Requirement Analysis in Software Development — explores one of the most critical phases of the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC): Requirement Analysis.
It explains how software requirements are identified, documented, validated, and translated into actionable specifications that guide successful project development.

What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of identifying, documenting, and managing the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system.
It ensures that the development team clearly understands what the users need and what the system must accomplish.

Importance in SDLC

Requirement Analysis acts as the foundation for all subsequent phases of software development — from design to deployment.
It helps avoid misunderstandings, reduces project risks, and ensures that the final product meets user needs effectively.

Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Prevents Scope Creep
By clearly defining what needs to be built, it helps prevent uncontrolled changes or expansions in project scope.

Ensures Stakeholder Satisfaction
It ensures that all user and business needs are well understood and implemented correctly.

Reduces Development Costs and Time
Early detection and correction of requirement issues are cheaper and faster than fixing them later in development or after deployment.

Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

The Requirement Analysis phase typically includes five key activities:

Requirement Gathering
Collecting initial information from stakeholders through interviews, surveys, or meetings.

Requirement Elicitation
Engaging stakeholders to refine and clarify their needs using techniques like brainstorming and prototyping.

Requirement Documentation
Writing detailed requirement specifications that serve as reference materials for developers and testers.

Requirement Analysis and Modeling
Structuring and analyzing requirements using models such as use case diagrams or data flow diagrams.

Requirement Validation
Ensuring that documented requirements accurately reflect stakeholder expectations and are feasible to implement.

Types of Requirements
1. Functional Requirements

These describe what the system should do — the features and functions that directly serve user needs.

Examples for Booking Management System:

Users should be able to create an account.

The system should allow users to search available rooms by date and type.

Users should be able to book a room and make payments online.

Admins should be able to view, confirm, or cancel bookings.

2. Non-functional Requirements

These define how the system performs its functions — focusing on quality attributes like performance, security, and usability.

Examples for Booking Management System:

The system should handle up to 10,000 concurrent users.

All transactions must be encrypted using HTTPS.

The website should load within 3 seconds on standard broadband.

The platform must be accessible on desktop and mobile devices.

Use Case Diagrams
Definition

A Use Case Diagram visually represents the interactions between users (actors) and a system, showing the various functions (use cases) the system performs.

Benefits

Provides a clear overview of system functionality.

Helps identify user roles and their interactions.

Serves as a communication tool between stakeholders and developers.

Acceptance Criteria
Definition

Acceptance Criteria are predefined conditions that a software feature must satisfy to be accepted by stakeholders.
They ensure that every feature delivers the expected outcome and meets quality standards.

Importance

Defines the boundary of a feature’s scope.

Ensures that both developers and stakeholders share a common understanding.

Serves as a basis for testing and validation.

Example – Checkout Feature (Booking System)

Feature: Checkout and Payment

Acceptance Criteria:

User must be able to review booking details before checkout.

Payment gateway must securely process credit/debit card transactions.

Upon successful payment, the user should receive an email confirmation and booking ID.

If payment fails, the system must display an error message and allow retry.

Booking status should automatically update to “Confirmed” after successful payment.
